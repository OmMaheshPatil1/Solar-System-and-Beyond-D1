        <h2>‚òÄÔ∏è The Sun</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Solar_sys8.jpg" alt="The Sun">
        <p>The Sun, a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star, is the heart of our solar system. It's a massive, glowing sphere of hot gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, generating energy through nuclear fusion. This energy supports life on Earth and drives the solar system's dynamic processes. The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the largest planets to the smallest particles in its orbit.</p>
        <p>With a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometers, the Sun contains 99.8% of the total mass of the solar system. Its surface, known as the photosphere, has temperatures around 5,500 degrees Celsius, while its core reaches temperatures exceeding 15 million degrees Celsius. Solar phenomena, such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, influence space weather and can impact Earth's magnetosphere, affecting satellite operations and communication systems.</p>

        <h2>ü™ê Planets of the Solar System</h2>

        <div class="planet">
            <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Mercury_in_true_color.jpg" alt="Mercury">
            <p>Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, is closest to the Sun at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers. It completes an orbit every 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury isn't the hottest planet; that title belongs to Venus due to its thick atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Mercury has a rocky body, heavily cratered and similar in appearance to Earth's Moon. Its thin atmosphere, composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium, is not substantial enough to retain heat, leading to extreme temperature fluctuations. Daytime temperatures can soar up to 430 degrees Celsius, while nighttime temperatures can plummet to -180 degrees Celsius.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet">
            <h3>Venus</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Venus_globe.jpg" alt="Venus">
            <p>Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is similar in size and structure to Earth, earning it the nickname "Earth's twin." However, its environment is vastly different. Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet, with surface temperatures around 465 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Its rotation is also very slow; a single day on Venus lasts about 243 Earth days, while a year on Venus is about 225 Earth days. The planet's surface features mountains, valleys, and tens of thousands of volcanoes, indicating significant geological activity.</p>

        <div class="planet">
            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg" alt="Earth">
            <p>Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to support life. It has a diverse environment, with vast oceans covering about 71% of its surface, and a protective atmosphere rich in nitrogen and oxygen. Earth's atmosphere shields us from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate temperature.</p>
            <p>Earth's interior is composed of a core, mantle, and crust, with tectonic activity shaping its surface over millions of years. This activity leads to the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Earth's magnetic field, generated by movements within its liquid outer core, protects the planet from solar wind and cosmic radiation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="planet">
            <h3>Mars</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg" alt="Mars">
            <p>Mars, known as the Red Planet due to its iron oxide-rich soil, is the fourth planet from the Sun. It has a thin atmosphere, composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with surface temperatures averaging -63 degrees Celsius. Mars features the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a vast canyon system, Valles Marineris.</p>
            <p>Evidence suggests that Mars once had liquid water, raising questions about its potential to support life. Robotic missions, such as NASA's Perseverance rover, continue to explore the planet's surface, searching for signs of past microbial life and studying its geology and climate. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, believed to be captured asteroids.</p>

            <h3>Jupiter</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter">
            <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It has a diameter of about 143,000 kilometers and is known for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm system larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries.</p>
            <p>Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even bigger than the planet Mercury. Missions like NASA's Juno spacecraft study Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and overall structure to understand the planet's formation and evolution.</p>

            <h3>Saturn</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Saturn_during_Equinox.jpg"Ó®Å0Ó®Ç
            <div class="img">
            <p>Saturn is the second-largest planet and is famous for its stunning ring system, made of countless icy and rocky particles. It has a low density, meaning it could float in water if a large enough ocean existed!</p>
            <p>Saturn has at least **83 moons**, with **Titan** being the most notable. Titan has a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes, making it one of the most Earth-like bodies in the solar system. Scientists believe Titan could potentially harbor some form of life.</p>

        <div class="planet">
            <h3>Uranus</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Uranus2.jpg" alt="Uranus">
            <p>Uranus is a unique gas giant that rotates on its side, likely due to a massive collision in the past. It has a faint ring system and at least **27 moons**, named after characters from Shakespearean plays.</p>
            <p>Uranus appears **blue-green** due to methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. It is the coldest planet, with temperatures dropping as low as **-224¬∞C**!</p>

        <div class="planet">
            <h3>Neptune</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Neptune_Full.jpg" alt="Neptune">
            <p>Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, is known for its deep **blue color** and the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of **2,100 km/h**!</p>
            <p>It has **14 moons**, the largest being **Triton**, which orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of its rotation. Scientists believe Triton was once a dwarf planet that Neptune captured.</p>

            <h3>Alpha Centauri ‚Äì Our Closest Solar System</h3>
            <img src="https://cdn.esahubble.org/archives/images/screen/potw1635a.jpg" alt="Alpha Centauri">
            <p>Alpha Centauri is the **nearest star system** to our solar system, located **4.37 light-years** away. It consists of three stars: **Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri**.</p>
            <p>Proxima Centauri is the closest of the three and has at least **one exoplanet**, **Proxima b**, which is in the habitable zone. Scientists are excited about the possibility of sending future probes to explore this system!</p>
